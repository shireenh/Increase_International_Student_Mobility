# Increase_International_Student_Mobility

This project was performed together with the University of Melbourne External Relationship Department and was aimed to determine international students mobility drivers. The study presents methodologies to identify which macroeconomic factors contribute to the decision to study abroad and which factors impact on the choice of destination. Another question under scrutiny was what does impact governments predisposition to sponsor students education overseas. To answer these questions, data for various macroeconomic factors was collected from authentic open data sources, followed by thorough data exploration and analysis. Based on that, Generalised Linear Model for student count data and Discrete Choice model were built to reinforce conclusions drawn during exploration phase. Research shows that high commodity prices incite governments to sponsor education of their citizens in overseas in high ranked universities and that growth of economy boost the number of students going study abroad on their own. Furthermore, it was found that exchange rates, cost of living, quality of education impact on the decision to go to study overseas.
